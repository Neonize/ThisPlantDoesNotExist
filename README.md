# This plant does not exist

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It is inspired by [ThisPersonDoesNotExist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) which seems to be down at the time of writing.

## Reason

This website should display different AI generated Plants and generate flavor text for them as well as provide an easy to use and open API.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
